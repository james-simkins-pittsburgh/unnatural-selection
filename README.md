# Unnatural Selection
A marine microbiology-themed RTS game. Copyright James Simkins.

Please note that I am keeping the copyright on the game and its code despite making this repository public. 
However, if there is a portion of the code that you would like to use for a game that is different 
from this one then I would be happy to license that part of the code under the Apache or MIT license. 
In other words, I am happy to share code, but I just don't want someone copying my entire game! 
If you do want to use my code, just email me at James.Simkins@proton.me.

I am writing this game primarily to become a better programmer in the Rust programming language.

This game is meant to be a much more advanced version of a game I wrote in Scratch called [Bioform Battle](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/EntropyIncorporated/). 

I hope that, with the Bevy game engine, I can support a much larger map with better graphics.
